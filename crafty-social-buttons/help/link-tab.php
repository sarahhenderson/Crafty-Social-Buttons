<p><strong>Link Buttons</strong></p>

<p>The <em>Link Buttons</em> will link to your profile on each of the selected social media services. This is what all the options do:</p>
		
<dl>
<dt>Image Set</dt>
<dd>Choose which icons you would like displayed on your site.   When you choose a different value, you should see the icons below change so you know what they will look like.</dd>

<dt>Caption</dt>
<dd>This text displays just before the icons.  If there's enough room, it will be to the left, otherwise it will be just above the icons</dd>

<dt>Show these services</dt>
<dd>Lets you choose which icons are displayed and in which order.  Just drag the icons to reorder them, and drag them between the selected and available boxes to include only the ones you want.</dd>

<dt>User IDs</dt>
<dd>For any service you choose, you should enter your username in the box.  This is so the link will go directly to your profile (e.g. your facebook page, your Etsy shop) and not just to the homepage of the site.</dd>

<p>Done forget to hit <em>Save changes</em> when you're done!</p>
